# Minimum Spanning Trees
参考：Algorithms 4th 4.3 Minimum Spanning Trees

## Definition
A spanning tree of a graph is a connected subgraph with no cycles that includes all the vertices. 
A minimum spanning tree(MST) of an edge-weighted graph is a spanning-tree whose weight (the sum of the weights of its edges) is no larger than the weight of any other spanning tree.
